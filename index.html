            My Name is Henry Seal. I am relatively new to website development. Iâ€™m certified through Ivy Tech for website and software design as well as self-taught. My main focus is on UI/UX and front-end web development. I am not a graphic designer, but I can edit logos (alternative versions, SVG conversion, color switch, etc.) and images if needed.

          <a href="http://henrysealmusic.com" target="_blank"><h2>Henry Seal Music</h2></a>
          <p>This is a personal site I built for my music. It's nothing special, but it didn't need to be. A friend of mine took the picture for the header and I added the fire effects in Photoshop.</p>
  
          <a href="https://henzwee.github.io/NMS-Fleet-Assistant/" target="_blank"><h2>No Man's Sky Fleet Assistant</h2></a>
          <p>Another simple website. I made this for a friend and me to use as we played the game No Man's Sky. It uses a JSONBin to share a to-do list that is shared between our two accounts. I've also trained an AI powered by ChatGPT on everything about the game. For that I used Eden AI.</p>
  
          <a href="https://www.theflatland.com" target="_blank"><h2>The Flatland</h2></a>
          <p>I was given the opportunity to work on some minor spacing and SEO issues for The Flatland. It was built with Squarespace. The main thing I was tasked with was the position of the drop-down navigation menu.</p>
  
          <a href="https://thehenryseal.wixstudio.com/shearchaossalon" target="_blank"><h2>Shear Chaos Salon</h2></a>
          <p>Shear Chaos Salon allowed me to create their first website. It was built using Wix. Everything is set up except the "Meet the Team" page and the online scheduler isn't active. I'm still working with the client, but the completed site should be live soon.</p>
  
          <a href="https://henzwee.github.io/Fallout-Fan-Game-Demo/" target="_blank"><h2>Fallout Fan Game Demo</h2></a>
          <p>While only a demo, there are still a few scenarios you can find yourself ending it in. I'm the only one working on it, including the script, images, and the website itself. It has not received the attention I'd like to give it, but there are more important projects.</p>

        <h2>Ed Martin Buick GMC</h2>
        <h3>June 2023 - Present</h3>
        <p>I do a little bit of everything here. I've worked with the parts and service departments and have had lots of customer service experience. My day to day consists of moving cars, picking up parts and customers, and helping out with anything I can for each department. Officially I'm a porter, but they think of me as more of an all-encopassing helping hand that does porter work when I'm not needed.</p>

        <h2>Papa John's Pizza</h2>
        <h3>May 2020 - June 2023</h3>
        <p>I worked here as a delivery driver and was responsible for helping close up shop most nights. My duties included dishes, folding boxes, prep, cleaning/sweeping, and of course making timely deliveries. I worked a lot of late nights here, and more than anything built up my patience.</p>

        <h2>The High School Years</h2>
        <h3>2016 - 2020</h3>
        <p>In high school I worked several jobs between various after-school activities. I worked for a house remodeling business, christmas tree farm, and even Dairy Queen. I leanred all the things you'd expect someone that age to learn from working.</p>
